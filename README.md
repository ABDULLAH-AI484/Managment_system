# Inventory Managment_system
This Inventory Management System is a FastAPI-based web application designed to help businesses efficiently track their inventory. The system provides a user-friendly interface with features for adding, removing, viewing, and searching inventory items, along with low-stock alerts to prevent shortages. Built with Python (FastAPI) for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, it offers a responsive design that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. Data is stored in a JSON file, ensuring simple setup without requiring a database.

During development, I encountered several challenges, including static file loading issues (fixed by correcting path handling), template inheritance errors and form submission problems (fixed by verifying POST methods and FastAPI routes). Additionally, I improved mobile responsiveness by refining media queries.
